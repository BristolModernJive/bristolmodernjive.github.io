<!-- As a society we all want to be back on the dance floor but the health & safety of our members has to be our priority. It is for this reason the committee has made the decision to begin Term 1 with online classes. This will be kept under constant review and decisions will be made in accordance with government guidlines and the Bristol SU advice. You will be able to join lessons via our zoom links and dance with flatmates or people in your social bubble. Throughout term 1 we still plan to have socially distanced socials and hope we can dance together soon. But until then online classes is our new norm and we can not wait to see you all on screen so buy your membership now!. -->
