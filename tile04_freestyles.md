# What are Freestyles?

Freestyles are special event usually happening on Friday or Saturday evening. They are great opportunities to do more dancing than in the classes, to try out our moves in different context, and with different people. All of us are filled with memories of amazing time we had at freestyles where we jived till the middle of the night!


# Freestyles during COVID

Due to COVID-19 local freestyles have been cancelled as per government regulations. We will keep you updated once they are allowed again!
