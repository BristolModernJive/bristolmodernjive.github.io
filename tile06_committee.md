		<h3>President: Mauro Camara Escudero</h3>
		<p>Hey Jivers! Iâ€™m Mauro and Iâ€™m super thrilled to be part of our new committee, which youâ€™ll get to know in the next few days through our social media. Iâ€™ve only been jiving since September and during this past year of Modern Jive I have made some incredible friends and learnt so much. I canâ€™t stress enough how lucky we are to have had such an outstanding committee who, together with our teachers Matt and Sarah, did a marvellous job at making classes lively and enjoyable last year. Iâ€™m looking forward to dancing and chatting with every single one of you, making sure that the society runs smoothly and, most importantly, ensuring that Thursday nights will be the highlight of your week, as they are mine! Meanwhile, we have a lot of exciting activities planned for this lockdown period, so stay tuned!</p>

		<h3>Music Rep: Ethan Shaw</h3>
		<p>Hi, I'm Ethan and I'm the music rep for this year. I'm the person in charge of taking your song requests and seeing whether they can go on the freestyle playlists, so be nice! I'm looking forward to meeting new members of the society and will hopefully be at least somewhat of a positive influence. I'm primarily a lead, though I'm open to trying out following at least once this year. I'm excited to meet you all this year and hope that we can inspire a new passion within some of you!</p>
