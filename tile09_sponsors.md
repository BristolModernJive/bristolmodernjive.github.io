We are currently running a Sponsorship draw. Each participanting business can purchase one or more tickets at the price of Â£20 each. On the 15th of September, we will draw a ticket and the corresponding business will become our official sponsor. The benefits of the official sponsor are listed below:

- It will be advertised on this page as our official sponsor.
- It will appear on our merchandise, as our unique and official sponsor.
- It will be advertised on our social media platforms.

All the remaining businesses will still be advertised on our social media platforms and listed on this page as sponsors!

To enter the draw, please email bristolleroc@gmail.com or message us on our Facebook Page.
