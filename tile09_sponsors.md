We are excited to tell you that this year we are sponsored by [PURE Spa & Beauty](https://www.purespauk.com/locations/bristol/spa-beauty-salon-bristol-park-street/) which is situated just at the bottom of Park Street! Keep an eye out because we are planning a collaboration with them.

They have kindly agreed to the following offers for Modern Jive Members:

- 25% off any first treatment
- 10% off all subsequent treatments


> PURE Spa & Beauty’s philosophy is simple — to combine essential spa and beauty treatments for time-starved individuals. Open late throughout the week in urban locations, our expert therapists are there for our clients even after their longest days! Our team was established by Becky Woodhouse, a chartered accountant with an avid interest in the beauty industry. She dreamed of running her own business and noticed a gap in the market for urban professionals wanting to take care of their health, well-being and beauty essentials.
