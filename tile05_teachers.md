Matt & Sarah have been dancing Modern Jive since 2003, though they didnâ€™t meet until 2007 - at a dance! They teach a weekly MJ class at the University of Bristol during term time (where Sarah learnt the dance when she was a student) and all over the country at weekenders and events. They have both competed at MJ competitions (not with each other!) and Matt is **twice World Champion**, amongst his many titles. Sarah has **UK Open national titles** to her name too. They were both part of the innovational **2 Hot Rhythm team** and then choreographed and coached the **Bristol University Student Team** (BUST) on the national competition circuit.  Both teams won national titles & the World Championships.
