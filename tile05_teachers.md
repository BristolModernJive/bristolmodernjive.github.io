# Modern Jive Teachers (partnered, on ZOOM)

Matt & Sarah have been dancing Modern Jive since 2003, though they didnâ€™t meet until 2007 - at a dance! They teach a weekly MJ class at the University of Bristol during term time (where Sarah learnt the dance when she was a student) and all over the country at weekenders and events. They have both competed at MJ competitions (not with each other!) and Matt is **twice World Champion**, amongst his many titles. Sarah has **UK Open national titles** to her name too. They were both part of the innovational **2 Hot Rhythm team** and then choreographed and coached the **Bristol University Student Team** (BUST) on the national competition circuit.  Both teams won national titles & the World Championships.

# Dance-Fitness and Choreo (solo, in-person)
Starting dance lessons as early as he could walk, Mevans has always had a relentless urge to dance whenever the chance arose; unfortunately for his friends this meant spinning around supermarket isles, shuffling around large streets and body-worming at parties.  By 17 he had his first taste of Modern Jive and over the following decade his passion transcended into performing, competing, choreographing and teaching dance professionally.  During this time Mevans qualified as a Personal Trainer and alongside weekly fitness classes now helps clients achieve their physical goals. 
Known for his energy, confidence and musical expression, Mevans hopes to spread the benefits of dance and physical training. Both activities can provide increased self-confidence and physical abilities, emotional outlets and a chance to build strong friendships.
