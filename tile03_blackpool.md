The modern jive society goes to world class jive competitions every year! These competitions take place in the UK and are open for beginner to professional, for pair, solo or teams. 

<p><span class="image right"><img src="{% link assets/images/blackpoolparty.jpg %}" alt="" /></span>The next one planed is the notorious <a href="https://wmjc-blackpool.com" target="_blank">World Modern Jive Championship</a>, taking place in Blackpool in March 2021. This will be an incredible weekend filled with lots of dancing and fun. Will you be joining us for the next one? 

We organize car shares and discounted accommodation in Blackpool for the 3 days of the competition so keep an eye out for our announcements on social medias and for tickets on the Bristol SU Modern Jive <a href="https://www.bristolsu.org.uk/groups/modern-jive-society" target="_blank">website</a>. 

Every day, after performances have ended, Freestyles and Parties begin until 2 am at night in the fantastic Blackpool Tower Ballroom so, even if you don't feel like competing, you can still join us for three days packed with dancing in one of the UK's most prestigious dance venues!</p>
